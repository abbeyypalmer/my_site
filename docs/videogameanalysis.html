        <h2>Little Nightmares</h2>
        <h3>For my video game analysis, I chose to play Little Nightmares. You play as a 9 year old girl named Six as she tries to escape the Maw, a mysterious vessel inhabbited by many creatures who try to stop you.</h3>

            <p>Little Nightmares is a puzzle horror game by Tarsier Studios. The game begins with a vision of a woman wearing a kimono and a noh mask, in what seems like a twisted dream with spooky music in the background. As the vision comes to a close, you awake as the character Six, a nine year old girl in a very distinctive yellow raincoat. She is always the brightest object on the screen, the background and objects are typically all brown and dark. The lighting also varies in some rooms, and can get so dark that you must use a lighter to see, which is the only thing Six carries on her. The game is similar to a more fleshed out version of Limbo, a puzzle horror game that came before. The graphics are pretty and the environment created is very immersive and convincing. It is an escape game, so your character is tasked with finding a way out of each room they enter. You begin in the prison, in which you do not encounter any of the bosses yet, but make a solo run to try and escape these rooms. It allows for you to experiment, explore, and figure out all of the controls. This is not a fighting game, so your main controls are to sprint, jump, climb, and slide. The escape from the rooms is not straightforward, and you must think hard and work to escape them. It is very immersive, and many of the escape routes can only be accessed by climbing up bookshelves and doors, or searching around nooks and crannies for a key. As you approach the end of this stage, you discover that Six gets hunger strikes, in which she doubles over every couple feet and moves very slowly(pictured above). At this point, some NPC throws you some bread, which you must eat to continue. </p>
            <p>The next stage is the Lair, which is where you meet your first boss. The janitor(pictured below) is a blind creature with unnaturally long arms that can scoop you up from across a room. Eventually, you experience another hunger strike and get captured by the janitor in a cage. You manage to break free and continue on, working your way through the levels as you continue to evade the janitor. This stage ends with you being trapped in a small closet and having to shut a heavy door on the janitor’s arms to escape. I find this stage interesting, because this is the only boss that you kill besides the final one. At first I found it unsatisfying to not be able to truly defeat the other bosses, as in the game you simply only escape from their areas. However, I think one of the main themes of this game is escapism, so it makes sense that not every stage ends in defeat of an opponent, but rather one step closer to freedom. </p>

            <p>The next stage is the Kitchen, in which you encounter two grotesquely large twin chefs. You must use a variety of tricks to escape them and move on to the next stage. This transition, however, is when you finally get to see the Maw in all of its glory, or the ship you have been stuck on. You get to climb up the outside of the ship, and in doing so you see that a stream of similarly large and grotesque “guests’ are currently boarding the ship. The next stage is the guest area, in which you are back inside and now see all of the guests who were entering previously are now gorging on food. Once you get closer to them, many try to eat you but they are slow and not too difficult to evade. There isn't technically one singular boss for this stage, but I consider all of the guests to be pretty close to a singular entity for you to escape, especially as on the final level of this stage they all surge towards you as one big crowd (pictured below). This is where a lot of the themes of gluttony and lust come in. The guests are so hungry and unconcerned with anyones well-being but their own, and will try to consume pretty much anything that moves. It can also show a very exaggerated view of how children see the adult world. </p>

            <p>The final stage is the Lady’s Quarters, in which you encounter the woman in the kimono who appeared to you at the very beginning. It is clear that she is the one in charge of the ship and the guests. Her room is strewn with broken mirrors and you eventually use an unbroken one to shine light on her to knock her down, which can be seen as a comment on vanity and the destruction it can cause. This is when your final hunger strike occurs, and you end up eating her and gaining her powers. The final scene is you walking out of the ship, and draining the life from guests who try to eat you before you eventually reach the outside world. </p>
            <p>This game was particularly interesting in the way that it explored childhood and the horrors that can be encountered. The ship, the Maw, is filled with all sorts of terrifying things for you to engage with. Pretty much everyone and everything in it are your enemies, which can be seen as a commentary on how the world can feel from the eyes of a child. It can feel confusing and like adults are out to get you, and you don’t understand why. All the aspects of the game can feel even more strong and powerful when you consider that the protagonist herself is quite weak. Six can not run very fast and is quite frail. You must rely more on stealth and intelligence to survive. Most people can relate to feelings of fear and inferiority during youth, and I feel that this game does a good job of exploring those feelings and concepts. </p>

            <p>There are many characters and locations in this game, so I created a Kumu network(pictured above) to represent the relationships between these two. At the middle of the network is Six, which makes sense as she is the one who traverses all of these areas, as well as interacts with the other characters. I saw some interesting connections once I created this network. For example, I realized that the Guest Area created the most connections between different characters, which is interesting because it is one of the shorter stages. The Guest Area could also be considered a turning point in the game, because even though it is not the final level, it is still accessed by escaping the underbelly of the ship and climbing up the side of the Maw to access this area. This offers the player a taste of freedom and creates tension leading towards the climax. One other connection is that all of the other characters besides Six are present in at least one other area of the ship besides the main one that they reside in. This creates a feeling of fearfulness, because it shows these terrifying characters are not solely confined to one area. There are not many objects in this game, and objects are typically only confined to the stage they originated in, so I did not include them in this network. I found the relationships between characters and locations as providing a better view of all of the intricate in-game connections, as this is what mainly contributes to the action and plot. </p>
            <p>Even though this game was relatively short (only took about ~3hrs for my first run), I felt that it was still a very well done and entertaining game. I did not have many complaints, but there were several things I thought of that would have made the game even better. One thing I noticed that could have made gameplay more interesting was more interaction between the character and the foreground and background. This is a 2.5d game, but there wasn’t a lot of interaction with the different areas of the stages in certain parts. Another thing would be that the main character has no ability to directly fight back using a weapon. However, this may have been done as a way to purposefully give the protagonist a disadvantage, so the player must be forced to compensate in other ways. Additionally, it would have been interesting to see more variety of environments in the gameplay. I loved the ambiance and cohesiveness that the different stages of the Maw created, however I can see how some people might feel as if it is a bit repetitive. Lastly, the difficulty level did not vary much as you moved through the stages. It would be interesting to see a version that gets progressively more difficult as you continue playing. One thing I wanted to add, however, is that there is a Little Nightmares II. My focus for this analysis is solely on the first game, but I wanted to add that I have played the second one and it addresses and fixes pretty much all of the complaints I previously mentioned. </p>
            <p>I am not a huge video game person, but I greatly enjoyed Little Nightmares and think more people should know about it. The developers did a good job creating beautiful yet creepy scenery, as well as a cast of interesting and diverse characters. There is a good mix between plot advancement and gameplay, and there is just enough left unsaid to leave the player wondering about the life of Six and the monstrosity that is the Maw and its inhabitants. I am very grateful that I got the experience of playing this game. There are many intricacies and things to explore, beyond even what I have included in my analysis. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bit of horror and likes puzzle games. I thought Little Nightmares was incredibly interesting, and I hope my analysis has made you think so as well.</p>
