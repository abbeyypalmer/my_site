            <h1>Digit 100 Essay</h1>
            <h3> For my Digit 100 class at Penn State Behrend, we were tasked with creating two websites. Both contain the same basic details and information, but the method of creating the sites was vastly different. One was created using GitHub and Oxygen HTML editor, while the other was created using a free web hosting service from Penn State (sites.psu.edu), linked <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/abbeysite/">here</a>. </h3>
            <h3>In general, I preferred creating my site using Oxygen. I loved the experience of learning and using HTML and CSS. It felt like I had a lot more creative freedom when designing and customizing my site. Learning the language of code also was very useful because it definitely wasn’t easy at first. It really is like learning a new language and requires you to think outside of the box to solve difficult problems. But once I worked on it for long enough, it finally clicked. HTML is a lot easier than people think, but also lengthy and challenging at some points. To me, this is what makes it so much more rewarding to complete. For example, I had such a difficult time at first trying to create my navigation bar. I had a very specific vision for what I wanted it to look like, so I had to spend a lot of time in CSS tinkering around with the code to get it just right. It feels very satisfying to be able to see your vision come to life.</h3>
            <h3>Comparatively, creating a site through Penn State is much easier to do but doesn’t require the same technical skills. While you can access and edit the code view of the site, the main interface is similar to web building sites such as Wix. While it is much easier than coding a website from scratch, there are some limitations to the structure and organization of content. I enjoy having full creative freedom over my projects, specifically when dealing with the stylistic aspects, so that was kind of discouraging to me. However, formatting text through the Penn State site is much easier than in HTML, at least for my current skill level. </h3>
            <h3>Overall, I had a good experience creating both sites, but found it more rewarding to use Oxygen, compared to the Penn State site. Building websites is a fun and creative exercise that I think everyone should experiment with, and it definitely made me view websites that I interact with regularly in a different way. 10/10 would recommend.</h3>
