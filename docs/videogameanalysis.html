        <h2>Little Nightmares</h2>
        <h3>For my video game analysis, I chose to play Little Nightmares. You play as a 9 year old girl named Six as she tries to escape the Maw, a mysterious vessel inhabbited by many creatures who try to stop you.</h3>

        <p> The game begins with a vision of a Geisha, in what seems like a twisted dream with spooky music in the background. As the vision comes to a close, you awake as the character Six, a nine year old girl in a very distinctive yellow raincoat. She is always the brightest object on the screen, the background and objects are typically all brown and dark. The lighting also varies in some rooms, and can get so dark that you must use a lighter to see, which is the only thing Six carries on her. The game is similar to a more fleshed out version of Limbo, a puzzle horror game that came before. The graphics are pretty and the environment created is very immersive and convincing. It is an escape game, so your character is tasked with finding a way out of each room they enter. You begin in the prison, in which you do not encounter any of the bosses yet, but make a solo run to try and escape these rooms. It allows for you to experiment, explore, and figure out all of the controls. This is not a fighting game, so your main controls are to sprint, jump, climb, and slide. The escape from the rooms is not straightforward, and you must think hard and work to escape them. It is very immersive, and many of the escape routes can only be accessed by climbing up bookshelves and doors, or searching around nooks and crannies for a key. As you approach the end of this stage, you discover that Six gets hunger strikes, in which she doubles over every couple feet and moves very slowly. At this point, some NPC throws you some bread, which you must eat to continue. The next stage is the Lair, which is where you meet your first boss. The janitor is a blind creature with unnaturally long arms that can scoop you up from across a room. Eventually, you experience another hunger strike and get captured by the janitor in a cage. You manage to break free and continue on, working your way through the levels as you continue to evade the janitor. This stage ends with you being trapped in a small closet and having to shut a heavy door on the janitor’s arms to escape. I find this stage interesting, because this is the only boss that you kill besides the final one. At first I found it unsatisfying to not be able to truly defeat the other bosses, as in the game you simply only escape from their areas. However, I think one of the main themes of this game is escapism, so it makes sense that not every stage ends in defeat of an opponent, but rather one step closer to freedom. The next stage is the Kitchen, in which you encounter two grotesquely large twin chefs. You must use a variety of tricks to escape them and move on to the next stage. This transition, however, is when you finally get to see the Maw in all of its glory, or the ship you have been stuck on. You get to climb up the outside of the ship, and in doing so you see that a stream of similarly large and grotesque “guests’ are currently boarding the ship. The next stage is the guest area, in which you are back inside and now see all of the guests who were entering previously are now gorging on food. Once you get closer to them, many try to eat you but they are slow and not too difficult to evade. There isn't technically one singular boss for this stage, but I consider all of the guests to be pretty close to a singular entity for you to escape, especially as on the final level of this stage they all surge towards you as one big crowd. This is where a lot of the themes of gluttony and lust come in. The guests are so hungry and unconcerned with anyones well-being but their own, and will try to consume pretty much anything that moves. It can also show a very exaggerated view of how children see the adult world. The final stage is the Lady’s Quarters, in which you encounter the Geisha who appeared to you at the very beginning. It is clear that she is the one in charge of the ship and the guests. Her room is strewn with broken mirrors and you eventually use an unbroken one to shine light on her to knock her down, which can be seen as a comment on vanity and the destruction it can cause. This is when your final hunger strike occurs, and you end up eating her and gaining her powers. The final scene is you walking out of the ship, and draining the life from guests who try to eat you before you eventually reach the outside world. </p>
