    <body>
        <para> Even now that <setting>we are out of sight of land</setting>, it seems impossible
            that I am actually off to <country>France</country> and, for the first time in my
                life,<risk> traveling alone.</risk> Everything has happened so quickly <risk>since
                the American Fund for French Wounded found an opening for me in
                <city>Paris</city></risk> that I suppose I am still somewhat dazed and bewildered.
            The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look ahead makes it
            easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of a taste in
                <city>New York</city> of the work that the A. F. F. W. is doing but its Headquarters
            in <city>Paris</city> will be different in some ways I fancy. </para>
        <para> I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few girls of my
            age are getting across, and<risk> I understood the grit and pluck which made you
                encourage me on my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so
                dangerous of late.</risk>
        </para>
        <para>
            <setting>As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing
                alongside,</setting> I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was
            in all our minds. How many of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was
            very quiet, no one spoke much, and, <setting>little by little, the glow faded from the
                sky and one star after another appeared.</setting> I knew that you would be looking
            at those same stars down in <city>Lakewood</city> and that your thoughts and prayers
            were the same that filled my heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate,
            after all. </para>
        <para> We waited <setting>near the Statue of Liberty until midnight</setting>—a rumor had it
            that a "personage" was to come on board. This individual was shrouded in mystery until
            we put to sea when it was given out that the party which had clambered aboard in the
            night was none other than the Italian Mission. Our spirits rose at once for, what with
            Frank Sayre on the boat and these distinguished Italian gentlemen, we shall doubtless be
            honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, <risk>thus far we have but two
                destroyers following us.</risk>
            <setting>They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, one on each side, and
                seem to be the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war.</setting>
            A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or
            five days but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping! </para>
        <para>
            <setting> I have a small inside cabin</setting> and my room-mate is quite a character.
            She is a native of <country>Haiti</country>, voluble and very portly—<setting>has four
                large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom,</setting> wears a costume which
            resembles a Mother Hubbard and smokes countless thin cigarettes that smell like incense!
            When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, luckily I am
            small, and <setting>I was soon tucked into the upper berth with my belongings!</setting>
            She really isn't bad and after looking me over carefully told me that she didn't think
            we would fight and from that time has beamed upon me! She is going over to join her son
            who has been fighting with the French since the beginning of the war but will never go
            back to the Front now, having lost some fingers off each hand. She is so thankful, she
            says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers. </para>
