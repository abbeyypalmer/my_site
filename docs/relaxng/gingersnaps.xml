<name>Gingersnaps</name>

<desc>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday season. But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</desc>

<item t="6">1/3 cup (113g) molasses</item>
<item t="7">2 1/3 cups (280g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</item>
<item t="8">1 to 2 teaspoons ginger</item>

<item t="12">1 teaspoon cinnamon</item>

<direct><part>Instructions</part>

<step>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.</step>

<step>Beat together the <item t="1">shortening</item>, <item t="2">sugar</item>, <item t="3">salt</item>, and <item t="4">baking soda</item>.</step>

<step>Beat in the <item t="5">egg</item>, then the <item t="6">molasses</item>.</step>

<step>Add the <item t="7">flour</item> and <item t="8,9,10">spices</item>, beating to make a smooth, fairly stiff dough.</step>

<step>To make the coating, combine the <item t="11">sugar</item> and <item t="12">cinnamon</item>, and place in a shallow pan or dish.</step>

<step>Drop the dough in 1" balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; a teaspoon cookie scoop is perfect here.</step>

<step>Roll the balls in the sugar to coat, then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2" between them; they'll spread as they bake.</step>

<step>Bake the cookies for 11 minutes, for cookies that are crisp around the edges, and "bendy" in the center. Bake for 13 minutes, for cookies that are crisp/crunchy all the way through.</step>

<step>Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Cool completely, then store tightly wrapped, at room temperature.</step></direct>
